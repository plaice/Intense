Java port of C++ libintense
---------------------------

This is intended to be a near-verbatim port of the core intense library in c++,
(i.e., not the other way around :-)).  It requires J2SE 1.4 or better, and
GNU Make.  The JFlex 1.4 jar is included in ext/, but shouldn't be required to
build (bad form, I know, but what the hey).

Update: A port of all of the C++ tests (minus context interpretation
in list and context mode, which has been stripped out for the initial
upload to gna.org) has been done, with the same test bases etc.
