Intense is a library of routines created to support intensional programming.
Intense supports the creation of tree-structured contexts, and their
manipulation using similar, tree-structured context operations.

Libintense was designed and written by Paul Swoboda, and has as its origins
a paper entitled A New Approach to Version Control, by John Plaice and
Bill Wadge, in IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, March 1993.

Intense is an extended reimplementation of a previous libintense, also
written by Paul Swoboda, which was used as the basis for the Perl-like
scripting language ISE (Intensional Sequential Evaluator), and for
Intensional HTML.  In turn, this former work was itself a generalization
of previous tools by Gordon Brown and Taner Yildirim.  All of this
earlier work was undertaken at the University of Victoria, BC, Canada.
