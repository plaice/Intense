Intense-AEP is a library implenting version 2 of the AEther Protocol.
AEP is a protocol for distribution and sharing of hierarchical
intensional contexts, as supplied by Intense.

Note: A bug in Fedora's pthreads implementation which screws up
deferred cancellation prevents this implementation from working on
Fedora and probably "Enterprise" RedHat... try Gentoo ;-).
